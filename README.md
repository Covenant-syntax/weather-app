My Weather App

My Weather App is a simple and user-friendly tool for checking real-time weather conditions and forecasts. This project started as a way to explore working with APIs and improve my JavaScript skills.

Features
Real-Time Weather Updates: View the current weather for any location worldwide.
Search by Location: Search for weather details by city name.
Detailed Weather Data: Access information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Dynamic Backgrounds: The app’s visuals change dynamically to reflect the current weather conditions.
What I Learned
Building this project has helped me develop and refine my skills in:

Working with APIs: Fetching data from weather APIs and processing JSON responses.
Asynchronous JavaScript: Using async/await and fetch() to handle API calls efficiently.
Error Handling: Managing errors gracefully, such as handling invalid city names or network issues.
CSS for UI Design: Creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
